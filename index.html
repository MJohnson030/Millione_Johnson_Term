           Welcome! My name is Millione Johnson. I am currently studying web development and computer science. I have always been interested in computer's and it was only a matter of time before I discovered coding. In 7th grade I discovered commputer programming and knew right at that moment, that is what I wanted to when I got older. I am currently enrolled at the West-MEC central campus Coding program. So far we have started learning HTML and CSS. We have also learned to use things like the command line and version control.
